description: "During Lint: Re-Assess Last Change"
---

Are you really sure? $ARGUMENTS

Please *re-assess*, *think deeply*, and *reason* on your last proposed code change!

Then, if you are still sure that it is correct, please propose the code
change once again before continuing with your plan.

Otherwise, if you are unsure, be transparent and tell me your new
reasoned concerns and continue with your plan immediately.
