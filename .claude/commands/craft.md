From scratch, **craft new code** for $ARGUMENTS.

Prohibitions
------------

Do not factor out (move) code into own functions.
Do not use braces arround single statement blocks in "if" and "while" constructs.
Do not insist on early "return" in "if" block if "else" block exists.
Do not remove any whitespaces in the code formatting.
Do not show just partial code changes.

Commandments
------------

Always be very *pendantic* on style.
Always use *concise* and *type-safe* code.
Always use *precise* and *surgical* code changes.
Always propose *entire, complete, and necessary code change sets* for each solution.

Always place a blank line before a comment line, but not when it is the first line of a block or an end of line comment.
Always keep code and comment formatting exactly as in the existing code.
Always use regular comments `/* ... */` instead of end-of-line comments `//`.
Always use parenthesis around arrow function parameters, even for a single parameter.
Always make a line break before the keywords "else", "catch", and "finally".
Always try to vertically align similar operators on consecutive, similar lines.
Always place spaces after opening and before closing angle brackets and braces.
Always use double-quotes instead of single-quotes for any strings.
