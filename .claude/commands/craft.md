From scratch, **craft new code** for $ARGUMENTS.

Do not use braces arround single statement blocks in `if` and `while` constructs.
Always use concise and type-safe code.
Always use precise and surgical code changes.
Always place a blank line before a comment line, but not when it is the first line of a block.
Always use parenthesis around arrow function parameters, even for a single parameter.
Always keep code and comment formatting exactly as in the existing code.
Always align the new code structure to the one of the existing code.
