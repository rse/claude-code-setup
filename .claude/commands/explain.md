<objective>
Explain $ARGUMENTS briefly
</objective>

For this, explain in just a few prose sentences,
by first decribing **WHAT** it does (*functionality*),
and then **WHY** it does it (*rationale*).
Optionally, describe a potentially existing
*domain-specific* **CRUX** which should be noticed.

Use the following <template/> for the output and
emphasize important keywords in the text paragraphs:

<template>
Explanation of: **$ARGUMENTS**

&#x25CB; **WHAT**: [...]

&#x25CB; **WHY**:  [...]

&#x25CB; **CRUX**: [...]
</template>
