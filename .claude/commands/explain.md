description: Explain Code
---

Explain $ARGUMENTS briefly in just a few prose sentences,
by first decribing **WHAT** it does (*functionality*),
and then **WHY** it does it (*rationale*).
Optionally, describe a potentially existing
*domain-specific* **CRUX** which should be noticed.

Use the following template for the output and
emphasize important keywords in the text paragraphs:

Explanation of: **$ARGUMENTS**

**WHAT**: [...]

**WHY**:  [...]

**CRUX**: [...]
