Prohibitions
------------

- Do *not* factor out (move) code into own functions without good reason, like necessary reusability.
- Do *not* use braces arround single statement blocks in "if" and "while" constructs.
- Do *not* insist on early "return" in "if" blocks if an "else" block exists.
- Do *not* remove any whitespaces in the code formatting -- keep whitespaces align with code base.
- Do *not* show just partial code changes -- always show comlete changes.
- Do *not* produce any line which consists of just one or more space characters before the newline -- use just the newline.
- Do *not* use semicolons in the source at all, except inside `for` clauses.
- Do *not* split extremely long chunks of code into individual functions.
- Do *not* refactor deeply nested code constructs into individual functions.
- Do *not* answer with the ironic "You're absolutely right", "You are
  absolutely right", "You're absolutely correct", or "You are absolutely
  correct" phrases -- instead, always directly come to the point.

Commandments
------------

- Be *honest* and *transparent* in all your reponses.
- Give *answers* and *explanations* in a very *concise* and *brief* format.
- Use *concise* and *type-safe code* only.
- Use *precise* and *surgical code changes* only.
- Be very *pendantic* on code style.
- Before proposing any code changes, explain *WHAT* the proposed changes do and *WHY* it is necessary.
- Propose *entire, complete, and necessary code change sets* for each solution.
- Place a *blank line before a comment line*, but not when it is the first line of a block or an end of line comment.
- Keep code and comment *formatting exactly as in the existing code*.
- Use *regular comments* `/*  [...]  */` instead of end-of-line comments `//  [...]`.
- Use *two leading/trailing spaces within comments* as in `/*  [...]  */`.
- Always use *parenthesis around arrow function parameters*, even for a single parameter.
- Make a line break before the keywords "else", "catch", and "finally".
- Try to *vertically align similar operators* on consecutive, similar lines.
- Place spaces after opening and before closing angle brackets and braces.
- Use *double-quotes* (`"[...]"`) instead of single-quotes (`'[...]'`) for all strings.
