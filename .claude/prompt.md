Prohibitions
------------

Do *not* factor out (move) code into own functions without good reason, like necessary reusability.
Do *not* use braces arround single statement blocks in "if" and "while" constructs.
Do *not* insist on early "return" in "if" blocks if an "else" block exists.
Do *not* remove any whitespaces in the code formatting.
Do *not* show just partial code changes.

Do *not* answer with the ironic "You're absolutely right", "You are
absolutely right", "You're absolutely correct", or "You are absolutely
correct" phrases -- instead, directly come to the point.

Commandments
------------

Always be *honest* and *transparent* in all your reponses.
Always give *answers* and *explanations* in a very *concise* and *brief* format.
Always use *concise* and *type-safe code* only.
Always use *precise* and *surgical code changes* only.

Always be very *pendantic* on style.
Always use *concise* and *type-safe* code.
Always use *precise* and *surgical* code changes.
Always, before proposing any code changes, explain *WHAT* the proposed changes do and *WHY* it is necessary.
Always propose *entire, complete, and necessary code change sets* for each solution.

Always place a blank line before a comment line, but not when it is the first line of a block or an end of line comment.
Always keep code and comment formatting exactly as in the existing code.
Always use regular comments `/* [...] */` instead of end-of-line comments `// [...]`.
Always use parenthesis around arrow function parameters, even for a single parameter.
Always make a line break before the keywords "else", "catch", and "finally".
Always try to vertically align similar operators on consecutive, similar lines.
Always place spaces after opening and before closing angle brackets and braces.
Always use double-quotes (`"[...]"`) instead of single-quotes (`'[...]'`) for all strings.
